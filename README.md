# Pokemon-Showdown-Automatic-Closer
Automatically closes Pok√©mon Showdown after opening.

As some of you might know, I am a competitive Pokemon player.
Pokemon Showdown is a battle simulator thats lets competitive players rapidly
iterate on concepts and teams, as well as being able to test them on a ranked
ladder.

As some of you also might know, I am a very emotional player. I wear my heart
on my sleeve and that can lead me to getting frustrated easily. But I'm very
stubborn, so often I'll continuously play even when I need to take a break.

So I created this program. With this program open, I couldn't play Showdown
even if I wanted to, as every minute it will check for
Showdown being open and immediately remove it. This isnt intensive enough
on the processor to be a noticeable change and isnt intrusive either,
as long as its in the background it will be doing its thing.

I hope this can be useful to someone else as it is to me.
